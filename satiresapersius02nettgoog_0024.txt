LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xvii

did not admire him. Two other persone, who had been fellow-students

r with him under Cornutus, are mentioned as men of great learning and

unblemished life, and zealous in the pursuit of philosophy-Claudius
Agathemerus of Lacedaemon, known as a physician of some name, and ⁴
Petronius Aristocrates of Magnesia. Such were his occupatione, and
such the men with whom he lived. The sixth satire gives us some
information about his habits of life, though not more than we might
have been entitled to infer from our knowledge of his worldly circum-
stances and of the custom of the Romans of his day. We see him there
retired from Rome for the winter to a retreat on the bay of Luna, where
his mother seems to have lived since her second marriage, and indulging .

in recollections of Ennius' formal announcement of the beauties of the
scene, while realiting in his own person the lessons of content and

tranquility which he had learned from the Epicureanism of Horace no
less than from the Stoicism of his philosophical teaehers. This may
probably have been his last work-written, as some have thought from
internal evidence, under the consciousness that he had not long to live,
though we must not press the language about his heir, in the face of
what we are told of his actual testamentary dispositions. The details of
his death state that it took place on the 24th of November, nn. 62,
towards the end of his twenty-eighth year, of a disease of the stomach,
on an estate of his own eight miles from Rome, on the Appian road.
His whole fortune, amounting to two million sesterces, he left tobis
mother and sister, with a request that a sum, variously stated ata
hundred thousand sesterces or twenty pouuds weight of silver, might
be given to his old preceptor, together with his library, seven hundred
volumes, chiefly, it would. seem, works of Chrysippus, who was a most
voluminous writer. Cornutus showed himself worthy of his pupil's
›liberality by relinquishing the money and accepting the books only.
He also undertook the office of reviewing his werke, recommending
that the juvenile productions should be destroyed, and preparing the
Satires for publication by a few slight corrections and the omission
of some lines at the end, which seemed to leave the work imperfect-
perhaps, as Jahn supposes, the fragment ofa new satire. They were
ultimately edited by Caesius Bassus, at his own request, and acquired
instantaneous popularity. The memoir goes on to tell us that Persius
was beautiful in person, gentle in manners a man of maidenly modesty,
an excellent son, brother, and nephew, of frugal and moderate habits.
This is all that we know of his life-enough to give the personat interest
which a reader of his writings will naturally require, and enough, t00,
to furnish a bright page to a history where bright pages are few. Persius
'was a Roman, but the only Rome that he knew by experience was the
