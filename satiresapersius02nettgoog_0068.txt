great man's doorstep. Noticess-human snarlers kept on the pre·

‘Ah, well-paint everything white from this day forward for
rue-I won't spoii your game. Bravo, you shall be wonders of
the world, every one of you. Is· that what you would like? No
nuisancea say you, to be committed here. Draw a couple of snakes,
young gentlemen, the ground is sacred: retire outside. l'm off.
Lucilius, though, bit deep into the town of his day, its Lupuses
and Muciuses‚ and broke his 'jan-tooth on them. Horace, the
rogue‚ manages to probe every fault while making his friend laugh3
he gains his entrance, and plays about the innermost feelings, with
a sly taient for tossing up his nose and catching the public on it.
And is it sacrilege for me to mutter a word? May it not be done
in confidence between myself anda ditch?’

114. secuit is applied to any kind of
wound. ‘Ambo (postes) ab infimo tarmes
κοίν’ Plaut. Most. 3. 2. 140, ⁴ gnawsff
Here we might take it for ‘secuit fla·
gello' hut for ‘genuinum' lior. 1 S.
10. 4 says of Lucilius, ‘sale multo Urbem
defricuit!
¹ 115. Lupus and Mucius were ene·
miss of Scipio, Lucilius' patron.

Lupus is said by the schol. on Hor.
28.1.68 ‘Tamosisve Lupo cooperto
versibus' to have been P. Rutilius Lupus,
who was consul 664 with L. Julius Cae·
sar, hut as Lucilius had then been dead
thirteen years, it seems more likely to
have been L. Lentulus Lupus, who was
consul with C. Marcius Figulus 597,
which is the opinion of Terentius in loc.
Hor.

Mucius. Ρ. Mucius Scaevola con-
sul 621. ‘Qrid refert dictis ignoscat
Mucius an nonl’ Juv. 1. 174.

genuinum fregit, perhaps with
reference to the story of the viper and the
file, alluded to by Hor. 2 S. 1. 77, though
the image here is meant to be to the
honour of Lucilius, who fastened on his
enemies without caring for the conse-
quences. ‘Animasque in vulnere ponunt‘
Virg. G. 4238. Contrast the different

passage.

116. omne .. vitium. Compare
such passages as Hor. 2 Ep. 2. 205 ‘Non
es avarus: abi. Qrid? cetera iam

simul isto Cum vitio fugerel' The re·

of his earlier works, though the word
ridenti expresses a principle laid down
more than once in the Satires, e. g. 1 S.
1· M6'10walf4er seems to answer to our
‘regne’ ‘Alfenus nasn' Hor. 1 S. 3.
130. ‘Surrentina vafer qui miscet faece
Falerna’ 2 S. 4. 55. Horace is so called
because he takes his friend in.
amico is opp. to ‘populum' Horace
takes his friends playfully to task for their
weaknesses, but is more contemptuous in
speaking of men in general, and mentions
obnoxious individuals even with bitter-
ness. Possibly ‘amico' may refer more
particularly to the Epistles.
117. admissus, ‘into the bosom!
praecordia is emphatic-he plays,
but it is with the innermost and most
sensitive feelings.
118. callidus.. suspendere, Prol.11.
