LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxix

constantly accustomed to look in the absence of anything more directly
conclusive. The memoir of Persius mentions Lucilius, but says not a
word of Horace: the quotations from Horace in the commentary of the
pseudo-Comutus are, as I have said, far from numerous: while the
difference of the poets themselves, their personal history, their philo·
“ sophical profession, their taste and temperament, the nature and power
of their genius is greater even than in the case of Persius and Lucilius,
and is only more clearly brought out by the clearer knowledge we
possess of each, in the possession of me whole of their respective
works. The fact, however, is only too palpable-so much so that it
puzzles uS, as it were, by its very plainness: we could understand a
less degree of imitation, but the correspondence which we actually see
makes us, so to speak, half incredulous, and compels us to seek some
account of it. It is not merely that we find the same topics in each, the
same class of allusions and illustrations, or even the same thoughts and
the same images, but the resemblance or identity extends to things which
every poet, in virtue of his own peculiarities and those of his time, would
naturally be expected to provide for himself. With him, as with Horace,
a miser is a man who drinks vinegar for wine, and stints himself in the
oil which he pours on his vegetables; while a contented man is one
who acquiesces in the prosperity of people whose start in life is worse

than his own. The prayer of the farmer is still that he may turn upa
pot of money some day while he is ploughing: the poet’s hope is still
that his verses may be embalmed with cedar oil, his worst fear still that
they may furnish wrapping for spices Nay, where he mentions names
they are apt to be the names oi Horatian personages: his great physician
is Craterus, his grasping rich man Nerius his crabbed censor Bestius,

his low reprobate Natta. Something is doubtless ducto the existence
of what, to adopt a term applied by Colonel Mure to the Greek epic
writem we may call satirical commonplace, just as Horace himself is
thought to have taken the name Nomentanus from Lucilius; or as,
among our own satirists, Bishop Hall talks of Labeo, and Pope of
Gorgonius, So Persius may have intended not so much to copy
Horace as to quote him-advertising his readers, as it were, from time
to time that he was using the language of satire. But the utmost that
can be proved is, that he followed prodigally an example which had been
set sparingly, not knowing or not remembering that satire is a kind of
composition which of all others is kept alive not by antiquarian asso-
ciatione, but by contemporary interest-not by generalized convention-
alities, but by direct individual portraiture. We can hardly doubt that a
wider worldly knowledge would have led him to correct his error of
judgment, though the history of English authors shows us, in at least one
