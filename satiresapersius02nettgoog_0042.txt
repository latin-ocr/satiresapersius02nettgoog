THE SATIRES

OF

¹ A. Pnnsrus FLACCUS

PROLOGUE.

Ι nsvnn got my lips well drenched in the hack's spring-nor do
Irecollect hav-ing had a dream on ¹the two-forked Parnassus, so

prosaic source—want of bread or love of
money. There seems no notion of satire
as a prosaic kind of writing, so that
Casaubon and Jahn's references to Horace
(1 sat. 4. 39;'a. 6.17) are scarcely ap·
posite, except as showing something of
theth same sort of modesty on the part of
bo .

1. fons caballinus, a translation of
Hippocrene. caballinus sarcastic, like
Gorgonei caballi, also of Pegasus (Jur. 3.
118), the term being contemptuous,
though its derivatives in modern lan·
guages hare, as is well known, lost that
shade of meaning.

labra prolui. Virg. Ae. 1. 743, of
Bitias, ‘pleno se proluit auro? Hor. 1 S.
5. 16 ‘prolutus vappa! The action im·
plies a deep draught, here taken by stoop-
ing down to the spring. (Contrast me
opposite expression, ‘primoribus labris
attingerel) ‘l never drank those long
draughts of Hippocrene, of which others

boast.' Here, asin the next verse, the
image is doubtless borrowed from the
Exordium of Ennius' Annals, as we may
infer from Prop. 3. a. (4.) 4 ‘Par-
vaque tam magnis admoram fontibus ora
Unde pater sitiens Ennius ante bibis!
Persius may have had his eye on two
other passages of the same Elegy. See
v. a ‘Bellerophontei qua fluit humor
equi,' and v. 52 ‘Ora Philetea nostra
rigavit aqua,’ and perhaps also on Hor.
rEp. 3. to ‘Pindarici fontis qui non
expalluit haustus, Fastidire lacus et rivos
ausus apertos!

.²· biceps, δίλοφοι, a perpetual epi·
thet of Parnassus. The mountain has
not really two tops, but as the Castalian
spring rises from between two ridges, it is
said to have thern (Urlichs and Millin·
gen, referred to by Jahn). Propertius, l. c.,
represents himself as laying down to sleep
under the shadow of Helicon. The source
of both passages is again Ennius' account
