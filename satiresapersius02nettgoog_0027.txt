divine providence. Dependence on the Deity was taught as a “is'
relative to independence of external circumstances, and the ancient pride
of the Porch erchanged for a humility so genuine that men have en-
deavoured to trace it home to a Christian congregation. A Stoic thus
schoolcd was not likely to become a political propagandist, evenis the
memory of the republic had been fresh, and the imperial power had
continued to be synonymous with tyranny-much less after dre assas-
sination of Domitian had inaugurated an epoch of which Tacitus could
speak as the fulfilment of the brightest dreams of the truest lovers of
freedom. Fifty years rolled away, and govemment became continually
better, and the pursuit of wisdom more and more honourable, till at last
the ideal of Zeno himself was realized, and a Stoic ascended the throne
of the Caesars, and the philosophy of political despair seemed to have
become the creed of political hope. The character of Marcus Aurelius
is one that it is ever good to dwell on, and our sympathies cling round
the man that could be rigorously severe to himself while tenderly in-
dulgent to his people, whose love broke out in their fond addresses to
him as their father and their brother: yet the peace of his reign was
blasted by natural calamities, torn by civil discord‚ and tainted by the

corruption of his own house, and at his death the fair promise of the
commonwealth and of philosophy expired together. Commodus ruled

the Roman world, and Stoicism, the noblest of the later systems, fell the
first before the struggles of the enfeebled yet resisting rivals, and the
victorious advanccs of a new and living faith.

Itis not often that a poet has been so completely identified with a
system of philosophy as Persius Greece had produced poets who were
philosophers, and philosophers who were writers of poetry ; yet our first

thought of Aeschylus is not as of a Pythagorean, or of Euripides as .

of a follower of the Sophists; nor should we elassify Xenophanes or
Empedocles primarily as poets of whose writings only fragments remain.
In Lucretius and Persius, on the other hand, we see men who hold a
prominent place among the poets of their country, yet whose poetry is
devoted to the enforcement of their peculiar philosophical views. The
fact is a significant one, and symptomatic of that condition of Roman
culture which I have noticed on a former occasion. It points to an age
and nation where philosophy is a permanent, not a progressive study—
an imported commodity, not an indigenous growth,-where the impulse
that gives rise to poetry is not so much a desire to give musical voice to
the native thought and feeling of the poet and his fellow-men, as a
recognition of the want of a national literature and a wish to contribute

towards its supply. At first sight there may seem something extravagant
in pretending that Persius can be called the poet of Stoicism in the sense
