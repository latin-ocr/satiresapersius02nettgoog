fairly, and even if they should be still unvanquished, are at any rate
palpably felt and appreciated. At the same time he presents many
salient points to the general student of literature: his individual charac-
teristics as a writer are sufficiendy prominent to strike the most careless
eye3 his philosophieal creed, ardently embraced and realized with more
or less distinctness, is that which proved itself most congenial to the best t
parts of the Roman mind, the Stoicism of the empire3 while his profes-
sion of authorship, as avowed by himself, associates him not only with
Horace, but with the less known name ol Lucilius, and the original con-
ception of Roman satire.

The information which we possess conceming the personal history oi
Persius is more copious than might have been expected in the case oi
one whose life was so short and so uneventful His writings, indeed,
cannot be compared with the ‘votive tablets' on which his two great
predecessors delighted to inscribe their own memoirs: on the contrary,
except in one famous passage, the autobiographical element is scarcely
brought forward at all. We see his character written legibly enough in
every line, and there are various minute traces of experienee with which
the facts of his-life, when ascertained, are perceived to aecord; but no
one could have attempted to construet his biography from his Satires
without passing even those extended limits within which modern eriti-
cism is pleased to expatiate. But there is a memoin much more full
than most of the biographieal notices of that period, and apparently
quite authentis, the authorship of which, alter being variously assigned to
his instructor and literary executor Cornutus, and to Suetonius, is now
generally fixed, agreeably to the testimony of the best MSS, on Valerius
Probus, the celebrated contemporary grammarian, from whose eom-
mentary, doubtless an exposition ofthe Satires, it is stated to have been
extraeted. Something has still been left to the ingenuity or research of
later times to supply, in the way of conjectural correction or illustrarim,
and in this work no one has been more diligent than Otto Jahn, to whom
Persius is probably more indebted than to any other editor, with the
single exception of Casaubon. 1 have, myself, found his commentary Α ι
quite invaluable while preparing my own notes, and l shall have to draw
frequently upon his Prolegomena in the course of the present lecture.

Aulus Persius Flaccus was born on the 4th of December, nu. 34, little
more than two years before the death of Tiberius, at Volaterrae in
Etruria, a country where antiquity of , deseent was most carefully
eherished, and which had reeently produced two men well known in
the annals of the empire, Maecenas and Sejanus. His father was of l
equestrian rank, and his relatives included some of the first men of his
time. The connection of the family with his birth-place is substantiated ¹
