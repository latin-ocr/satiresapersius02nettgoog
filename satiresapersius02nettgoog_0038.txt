LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxxi

’ There is nothing in Horace or Juvenal more striking than the early part

of the third satire, where* the youthful idler is at first represented by a
series of light touches snoring in broad noon while the harvest is

¹ baking in the fields and the cattle reposing in the shade, then starting

up and calling for his books only to quarrel with them-and afterwards
as we go further the scene darkens, and we see the figure 01 the lost
profligate blotting the background‚ and catch an intimation 01 yet more
10011111 punishments in store for those who will not be wamed in time-
punishments dire as any that the oppressors 01 mankind have suffered or
devised-—the beholding 01 virtue in her beauty when too late, and the
consciousness of a corroding secret which no other heart can share.
Nor would it be easy to parallel the effect of the sketches in the first
satire, rapidly succeeding each other,—the holiday poet with his white
dress and his onyx ring tuning his voice for recitation ; a grey and
bloated old man, giving himself up to cater for the itching ears 01 011101ος
the jaded, worn company at the table, languidly rousing themselves in
the hope 01 some new excitement; the inferior guests at the bottom of
the hall, ready to applaud when they have got the cue from their betters
-all flung into a startling and ghastly light by the recollection carefully
presented tous that these men call themselves the sons of the old
Romans, and recognize poetry as a divine thing, and acknowledge the
object of criticism to be truth. Again we see the same pictorial skill
and reality, though in a very different style, toned down and sohered, in
those most sweet and touching lines describing the poet's residence with
his beloved toacher, when they used to study together through long
summer suns and seize on the first and best hours 01 the night for
their social meal, each working while the other worked and resting
while the other rested, and both looking forward to the modest enioy-
ment of the evening astho crown 01 0 well-spent day. Persius’ lan-
guage hasbeen censured 101 110 harshness and exaggeration: but here,
at any rate, he is as simple and unaifected as an admirer 01 Horace 01
Virgil could desire. The contrast is instructive, and may perhaps
suggest a more favourable view of those peculiarities of expression
which are generally condemned. The style which his 10010 leads him
to drop when he is not writing satire, is the style which his 10010 leads
him to assume for satiric purposes. He feels that a clear, straight-
forward, everyday manner of speech would not suita subject over which
the gods themselves might hesitate whether to laugh or to weep. He
has to write the tragi-comedy of his day, and he writes it in a dialect
where grandiose epic diction and philosophical terminology are strangely
blended with the talk of the forum, the gymnasia, and the barber’s
shop. Ι suggest this consideration with the more confidence, as I find it
