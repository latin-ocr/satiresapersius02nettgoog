LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSlUS. ,xxi

-in which Lucretius is the poet of Epicureanism, as if there were equal
scope for the exposition ol a philosophy in a few scholastic exercises
and in an elaborate didactic poem. On the other hand, it should be

’ recollected that under the iron grasp of the Roman mind, Stoicism, as

was just now remarked, was being reduced more and more to a simply
practical system, bearing but a faint impress of those abstruse cosmo-
logical speculations which had so great a chaum for the intellect of Greece
even in its most sober momenta, and exhibiting in place of them an
applicability to civil life the want of which had been noted as a defect in
the conceptions of Zeno and Chrysippus ¹. The library and the lecture-
room still were more familiar to it than the forum or the senate ; but the
transition had begun: and though Persius may have looked to his seven
hundred volumes for his principles of action, as he did to Horace for in-
formation about the ways of the world, the only theory which he strove
to inculcate was the knowledge which the founders of his sect, in com-
mon with Socrates believed to be the sole groundwork of correct prae-
tice. Using the very words of Virgil, he calls upon a benighted race to
acquaint itself with the causes ol things: but the invitation is not to that
study of the stars in their courses‚ of eclipses, and earthquakes and
inundatione of the laws governing the length of days and nights, which
enabled Lucretius to triumph over the fear ol death, but to an inquiry
into the purpose of man's being, the art of skilful driving in the chariot-
race of life, the limits to a desire of weaith and to its expenditure on
unselfish objeets, and the ordained position of each individual in the
social system. Such an apprehension of his subject would naturally lead
him not to the treatise, but to the sermon-not to the didactic poem, but
to the satire or moral epistle. But though the form of the composition
is desultory, the spirit is in the main definite and consistent. Even in
,the first satire, in which he seems to drop the philosopher and assume
the critic, we recognize the same belief in the connection between intel-
lectual knowledge and practice, and consequently between a corrupt
taste and a relaxed morality, which shines out so clearly afterwards when
he tells the enfranchised slave that he cannot move a finger without
committing a blunder, and that it is as portentous for a man to take
part in life without study as it would be for a ploughman to attempt to
bring a ship into port. It is true that he follows Horace closely, not
only in his illustrations and descriptions of mannem, but in his lessons
of morality—a‚ strange deferenee to the man who ridiculed Crispinus and
Damasippus, and did not even spare the great Stertinius3 but the evil
and folly of avariae, the wisdom of contentment and seli-control, and the
