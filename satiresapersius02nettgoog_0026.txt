LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xix

ζ were only so many registers of his sins of omission. There was, in
{ truth, no encouragement to pursue a different course. Seneca's attempt
ξ to scat philosophy onthe throne by influencing the mind of Nero, had
’ issued only in his own moral degradation as the lying apologist oi

matricida, and the receiver of a bounty which in one of its aspects was
plunder, in another corruption; and though his retirement, and still more
, his death, may have sufficed to rescue his memory from obloquy, they
could only prove that he had learned too late what the more consistent
members of the fraternity knew from the beginning. From such a
govemment the only notice that a Stoic could expect or desire was the
sentence which hurried him to execution or drove him into banishment.
Even under the rule of Vespasian the antagonism was still unabated.
At the moment of his accession, Euphrates the Tyrian, who was in
his train, protested against the ambition which sought to aggrandize
itself when it might have restored the republic. Helvidius Priscus,
following, and perhaps deforming, the footsteps of his father-in-law
Thrasea, ignored the politicai existence of the emperor in his edicta
as praetor, and asserted his own equality repeatedly by a freedom of
speech amounting to personal insuit, till at last he succeeded in ex·
hausting the *forbearance of Vespasian‚ who put him to death and
banished the philosophers from Italy. A similar expulsion took place
under Domitian, who did not require much persuasion to induce him to
adopt a policy recommended by the instinct of sels-preservation no less
than by Nero's example. Meantime, the spirit of Stoicism was gra-
dually undergoing a change. The theoretic parts of the system, its

, physics and its dialectics, had found comparatively little favour with the

Roman mind, and had passed into the shade in consequence: but it was
still a foreign product, a matter of learning, the subject of a voluminous
literature, and as such a discipline to which only the few could submit
It was still the old conception of the wise man as an ideal rather than a
reality, a being necessarily perfect, and therefore necessarily super·
human. Now, however, the ancient exclusiveness was to be relaxed‚
and the invitation to humanity made more general. ‘Strange and
shoclring would it be,' said Musonius Rufus, the one philosopher
exempted from Vespasian’s sentence, ‘if the tillers of the ground were
incapacitated from philosophy, which is reallya business of few words,
not of many theories, and sar better learnt in a practical country life than
in the schools of the city! In short, it was to be no longer a philosophy
but a religion. Epictetus, the poor crippled slave, as his epitaph pro·
claims him, whom the gods loved, turned Theism from a speculative
dogma into an operative principle, bidding his disciples follow the divine
service, imitate the divine life, implore the divine aid, and rest on the
