Ι SAT. Ι. 35

One-eye, thinking himself somebody forsooth, because once stuck
up with provincial dignity, he has broken short half-pini measurcs
officially at Arretium3 nor the man who has the wit to laugh at
the figures on the slab and the cones drawn in sand, ready to
go off in ecstasies ifa woman pulls a Cynic by the beard. To
these Ι allow the play-bill for their morning's reading and after

luncheon Calliroe!

for the purpose of drawing figures and
making calculations. jahn. Heius. quotes
Apul. Apol. p. 284 ‘si nou modo campo
et glebis. verumetiam abaco et pulvisculo
te dedisses! Others, like casaubon,
separate the ‘abacus’ from the ⁸ pulvis,’
making the former an arithmetical count-
ing·board-the.latter the sand on the
ground on which geometers described
their diagrams, as Archimedes, called by
Cic. Tusc. 5. ²3 ‘homunculus a pulvere
et radio’ (Kdnig), was doing at the
time of his murder. Cicero (N. D. a. 18)
speaks of ‘eruditus pulvis! Casaubon.
The original meaning of ‘meta’ is ‘a
cone! See Freirnd. ‘Burrus in metas
emittitur’ Ptin. 16. 16. 28.

¹32· scit risisse, v. 53, ‘has the

discerument to laugh.’

vafer, v. 116. ‘Laudare paratus'
Juv. 3.106, who is fond of the con-
struction, ‘he has learnt his lesson and is
primed and ready to go off.’

pueri' Hor. rs. 3.133, speaking to a
Stoic. . '

nonaria, seemingly only found here,

so called because not allowed to appear in
public before rhe ninth hour, the tinre of
dining(llor.1Ep.7.71). ·

134· Persius probably thought oi
Horace's edict (1 Ep. 19. Β) ‘Forum
putealque Libonis Mandabo siccis, adi·
mam cantare severis,¹ as casaubon ob-
serves.

edictum seems best taken as the
‘play-bill,’ as in Sen. Ep. 117. 30 (quoted
by Marcilius) ‘Nemo qui obstetricem par·
turienti filiae sollicitus arcessit, edictum et
ludorumordinemperlegit.' The‘edictum'
of the praetor would be less interesting
to this class of idlers, and besides cannot
have been a daily object of curiosity.

Calliroe, a poem of the Phyllis and
Hypsipyle stamp (v. 3'4), which would be
recited after dinner. The schol. says that
one Atinesli) Celer wrote a puerile
comedyff) on the subject. The context
seems to require some literary trash, as a
set off against Persius' own productioris.
The spelling ‘Calliroen' is adopted by
jahn frorn the MSS. There is no such
form as ‘Callirhoe’ the choice being be·
tween Καλλιρῤόη and Καλλιρόη.
