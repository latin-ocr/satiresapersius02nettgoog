Rome as well as at Athens. Attius wrote
on both subjects. Varius was the author
of a Thyestes and Seneca, whose playis
extant. See also Juv. 7. ra. 73, Mayor’s
notes. Thyestes was one oi Nero's cha-
racters, Dio. 63. 9, etc. referred to by

Thyestes is mentioned twice by Horace

to ridicule the people through their fa·
