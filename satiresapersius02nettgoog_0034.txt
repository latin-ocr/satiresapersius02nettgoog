LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxvii

was that of making 'satire henceforward synonymous with free speaking
and personality-he comes before us as the reviver of the Fescennine
licence, the imitator of Cratinus 3ηά Eupolis and Aristophanes. There
seems to have been about him a reckless animal pugnacity, an exhi·
larating consciousness of his powers as a good hater, which in its rude
simplicity may remind us of Archilochus and certainly is but faintly
represented in the arch pleasantry of Horace, the concentrated intel·
lectual scom of Persius, or the declamatory indignation of Juvenal.
Living in a period of political excitement, he plunged eagerly into party
quarrels. The companion of the younger Scipio and Laelius, though
amere boy, 3ηά himself of equestrian rank, he attached great consular
personages who had opposed his friends: as Horace phrases it, he tore
away the veil from private life and arraigned high and low alike-showing
no favour but to virtue and the virtuous-words generally found to bear
a tolerably precise meaning in the vocabulary of politics. It was the
satire of the republic, or rather of the old oligarchy, and it was impos·
sible that it could live on unchanged into the times of the Empire. But ·
the memory of its day of freedom was not forgotten: the ancient right of
impeachment was claimed formally by men who' intended no more than

’ acommon criminal information; 3ηά each succeeding satirist sheltered

himself ostentatiously under an example of which he knew better than to
attempt to avail himself in practice.

It was to Lucilius, as we have already seen, that Persius, if reliance is
'to be placed on the statement of his biographer, owed the impulse that
made him a writer of satire. Of the actual work which is related to have
produced so remarkable an effect on its young reader, the tenth book,
scarcely anything hasbeen preserved ; while the remains of the fourth,
which is said to have been the model of Persius’ third satire, com-
paratively copious and interesting as they are, contains nothing which
would enable us to judge for ourselves of the degree of resemblance.
Hardly a single parallel from Lucilius is quoted by the Scholiasts on any
part of Persius: but when we consider that the aggregate of their cita-
tions from Homer, though much larger, is utterly inadequate to express
the obligations which are everywhere obvious to the eye of a modern
scholar, we cannot take their omissions as even a presumptive proof
that what is not apparent does not exist. On the other hand, the
Prologue to the Satires, in scazon iambics, is supposed, on the authority
of an obscure passage in Petronius, to have had its prototypa in a
similar composition by Lucilius; and it is also a plausible conjecture
that the first line of the first satire is taken bodily from the old poet—
two distinct proclamations of adhesion at the very outset, in the ears
of those who could not fail to understand them. There is reason, also,
