SA'T. IV. 79:

the aversion of the gods and the enemy of his genius, who, ⁸when-
ever he fastens up the yoke at the feast of crossroads, and thorough-
fares, in the extremity of 'his dread of seraping off the ancient
incrustation from his dwarf wine jar, groans out, ‘May it be for
tlte bestl' as he munches onionS, ¹coats and all,=with salt, and¹
while his slaves are clapping their hands with ecstasy over the mess¹

of meai, gulps down the mothery lees of expiring vinegar.''

fears he is doing wrong in drawing tlte
wine, ‘May lt turn out well¹ or ‘bring a
bleasing,' like Agamemnon’s εὖ γὰρ εἴη,

(Aesch. Ag. ²16).

tunica is used by Juv. 14. 153

· tended in the use of the participle, which

was an ordinary epithet of the common
people (Hor. 1 Ep. 7. 65), perhaps like
Horace’s ‘caepe trucidas’ (1 Ep. la. ar),
a reference to the Pythagorean reverence
for vegetable life. The onions of course
’ are eaten with their skins as more fitting,

mon on these occasions of licente, as an.
acknowledgment to the founder of the,

here bestowed on a meal which other

supported by three MSS.¹ two of thern
old: but the great majority is in favour

aS.3.116 says of a miser ‘acre potet
acetum‚’ wine which has 'become mere
vinegar: but Persius, as Casaubon remarks,
strengthens every word—not ‘acetum'
merely, but ‘pannosam faecem aceti mo·¹
