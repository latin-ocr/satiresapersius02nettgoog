LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxv

apparently combining one of the actual requisites os the Roman medley‚

' the mixture of metres, with the biting invective of the later satire-a
work which, when fixed at its latest date, must have been one of the
'll concomitants‚ if not, as Aristotle thinks, the veritable parent, of the
earlier comedy of Greece. In later times we find parallels to Roman

logues noticed by the criticS, of which the Adoniazusae is the best
instance, but in the poem entitled the Charites, where the poet com·

But Greece was not ordained to excel in everything ; and Rome had the
opportunity os cultivating a virtually unbroken field os labour which was
suited to her direct practical genius and to her mastery over the arts of
social life. There can be no question but that the conception of seizing
the spirit of comedy-of the new comedy no less than the old—the
comedy ol manners as well as the comedy of scurrilous burlesque—and
investing it with an easy undress clothing, the texture of which might
be varied as the inward feeling changed, was a great advance in the
progress of letters. It would seem to be a test of the lawlul develop-
ment of a new form of composition from an old, that the latter should be
capable ol including the earlier, as the larger includes the smaller. So
in the development of the Shaksperian drama from the Greek the
chorus is not lost either as a lyrical oras an ethical clement, but is
diffused over the play, no longer seen indeed, but felt in the art which
heightens the tone of the poetry‚ and brings out the moral relations of
the characters into more prominent relies. So in that great development
which transcends as it embraces all others the development of prose
lrom poetry‚ the superiority of the new form to the old as a general
vehicle of expression is shown in the expansive flexibility which can
find measured and rhythmic utterance for the raptures of passion or
imagination, yet give no undue elevation to the statement ol the plainest
matters of lact. And so it is in the generation of satire from comedy:
the unwieldy framework of the drama is gone, but the dramatic power
remains, and may be summoned up at any time at the pleasure ol the
poet, not only in the impalpable shape ol remarks on human character,
but in the flesh·and-blood fulness of actual dialogue such as engrosses
several of the satires of Horace, and enters as a more or less important
ingredient into every one ol those of Persius. Or, if we choose to
regard satire, as we are fully warranted in doing, in its relation not
only to the stage but to other kinds of poetry‚ we shall have equal
reason to admire it forits elasticity, as being capable of rising without
