and the ghastly inward paleness, which is emystery, even to the
wife of the bosom?

Osten, Ι remember, as a small boy Ι used to give my eyes a
touch with oil, 11 Ι did not want to leam Cato's grand dying
speech, sure to be vehemently applauded by my wrong-headed
master, that my father might hear me recite in a glow 01 perspir-
ing ecstacy with a party of friends lor the occasion. Reason good,
for the summit of my scientific ambition was to know what that
luclry sice would bring me, how much that ruinous ace would
sweep off -never to be ballred by the narrow neck of the jar,
or to let any one be cleverer at whipping the top. But you
have had some practice in detecting deviatione from the rule 01

‘unio ') stands, as Jahn and Heinr. think,
sor three sires, rpls if, the highest throw
with the ‘tesserae' (‘Venus‚’ or ‘iactus
Venereus'). The highest throw with the
‘tali' which were four in number, was
when all four turned up differently (Lu-
cian. Am. p. 415, Or. A. Α. a. 204
1011, Tr. a. 471 solt). See Freund v.

point being to throw thern into a hole
(βόθροι), or, as here, into a jar, so as not
to count those which fell outside. The
narrowness 01 the neck (‘collo angustae ’
