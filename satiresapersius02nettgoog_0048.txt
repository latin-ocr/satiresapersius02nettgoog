SAT. Ι. 11

walking up and conecting the lying tongue in that balance of
theim, or asking any opinion but your own—sor who is there at
Rome that has not-if I might only say itl But surely I may,
when I loolr at these gray hairs of ours, and this dreary way of
living, and, in short, all our actions from the time of ilinging our
toys asido, when we take the tone of uncles and guardians. YeS,
you must excuse me, tien?

No, I won’t.

‘What am I to do? but Ι am constitutionally a great laugher,
witha saucy spleen of my own!

‘We shut ourselves up and write, one verse, and another prose,
all in the grand style to be panted forth by the lunge with a vast
expenditure of breath. lies-you hope to read this out some day,

this is the upshot.' Jahn compares Ov.

cachinno, according rothe Schol.
a noun, like ‘gluto' 5.112, ‘palpo' ib.
176. Lucilius appears to have been fond
ef words of this kind, possibly as being in
use among the common people, as ‘ lurco‚'
‘comedo' Fr.4. , ‘combibe’ 26. 60.
‘mando’ lnc. 8, catillo’ 4. 4 Dous.
Hermann, following Heindorf, makes
‘cachinno’ a verb, taking ‘ignoscite..
splene’ as aparenthesis—‘Excuse me,
lam sorry to do it, butlcannot help my
spleen;' but this would be awkward:
and though ‘cachinno' as a noun is
found nowhere else, the evidence of the
Schol. is enough to show that its exist·
ence was not thought impossible at the
fime when Latin was still a living lan·

13—23. The attack begins. P. ‘A
composition is produced with intense
labour. lt is then recited in public by
the author, dressed in holiday attire, with
the most effeminate intonation; and the
descendants of Romulus are tickled, and
feel their passions excited. Shame that an
old man like that should' so disgrace
himself 1'

13. The form of the verse was pos-
sibly suggested by Hor. aEp. 1. 117
‘Scribimus indocti: etc.

13. inclusi points the satire—‘a man
shuts himself up for days and days, and

bentis et otia quaerunt! Juv. 7. a?
‘Qri facis in parva sublimia carmina
cella! Markland ingeniously but need-
lessly conjectures ‘inclusus numeris ille.'

pede liber opposed to ‘numeros'
apparentlyn‘ soluta oratio,’ aa no lrind of
verse could be well contrasted with
‘numeri' even Pindar's' dithyrambics
being ‘numeri lege soluti! The stress,
however, is laid throughout the Satire on
poetical recitations, as in Juv. S. 1 and 7;
and rhetoric is merely introduced (v. 87)
with reference to the courts oi law. ‘Pede
liber '=‘ pede libero.'

14. grande aliquid, in apposition
to ‘numeros' and to the notion con-
tained in ‘pede liber.’ ‘Res grandes'
v. 68, ‘Gnade locuturi' 5. 7. ‘Grandis’
seems to have been a cant term at Rome
in Persius' tirne. Sen. Comp. 5. ro ‘Tu

of mouthing it! Jahn, in his text of
1868, adopts ‘ quo’ from Montp.

praelargus, a rare word. ‘Largus

prodigal of life, perhaps from Hor. 1 Od.
