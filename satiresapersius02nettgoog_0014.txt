PREFACE. vii

of the first four pages of the Persius (fol. 94 nerse to fol. 96),
where the letters are tall and thin, not, as generally, broad and
ilat. The characters, however, appear to be the same. There
are other glosses, apparently written at the same time as the

text and in* the same hand, some between the lines, some

towards the margin, evidently earlier than those just spoken

of, which in one place leave a space in the middle ofa line for
an intrusive word of the earlier gloss written out of the straight
line. These earlier glosses are much less copious than the later:
they extend, however, somewhat further, to folio 98, the end
of Sat 1, after which they almost disappear, scarcely averaging
one in a page? The chief peculiarity of the writing of this MS.
(which Ι have myself collated with Jahn's text of 1868) is the
shape of r, which is so formed as to be easily confused with n.
l num rs often written tan, so that in sat, 4 35 it is not at
first sight easy to decide whether the reading is in meres or
lei meres. As regards orthography, this MS. is much freer from
mistakes than the MS. of Juvenal bound in the same cover and
apparently written by the sanie hand, in the tenth satire of
which I found such misspellings as gretia for Graecia, canicies
for canities, contentus for concentus, sotio for secie, and thematule
for tomacula. This confusion between c and t is almost un-
known to the MS. of Persius: patritiae (Sat. 6. 73) being per·
haps the only instance of it. In Sat. 1. 116, however, it is diffi-
cult to make out whether the scribe has written muti or muci.
The chief confusions of 'consonants which this MS. exhibits are
between b and p (obtare for optare, rapiere for rabiosa): between
g and gn (pingue for pinge, leugues for lenges): between s and ’
ss (ammiras, erigena for amissus, assigna: cassiam, recusso for
casiam, recusa, etc.): between m and mm,p and pp, c and cc
(imitere for immittere, ammemis for amomis, suppellex for supellex,
quipe for qnippe, peccari ior pecori, etc.) Among the vowels a
