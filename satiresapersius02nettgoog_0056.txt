and Exquisite— for just sift this Exquisite to the bottom‚ and
what do you not find there? Is there not Accius' Iliad dead·
drunk with hellebore? Are there not all the sweet little love poems
ever dictated by persons ol quality after their meals—irr a word,
all the verse that is produced on couches of citroni You know
how to serve up a sow’s paunch smoking hot-you know how to
present a poor shivering dependant with a cast-off cloak—and
you say, “Truth is my idol-pray tell me Truth about myself.”
Truth—how can you expect to hear it? Well will you have it,
then? You 're a twaddler‚ you old baldpate‚ with your bloated
stomach projecting a good half yard before you. Ο lucky Janus,
never to have a stork's bill pecking at you behind-or a hand
that can imitate by its motion a donkey’s white ears, or a length oi
tongue protruded like an Apulian dog’s in the dog-days! But you,

than a neuter, as is shown by such pas·
rages as Prop. 3. 5. 25 ‘Et mater non
justa piae dare debita terrae, Nec pots
cognatos inter humare rogos! ‘s' is eli-

the imitation of an ass'r ear, is still corn·
mon in Italy.

58. ciconia. The tingere seem, accord-
to the schol, to have been tapped against

ded before a consonant, and ‘i’ conse·
quently becomes ‘e‚' as the final ‘i' in
Latin would not be short. So ‘magis'
aud‘mage.’

56. nugari is used elsewhere.as inllor.
2 E. 1. 93, for graceful trifling iu art and
literature; here it has the force oi the
bitterest contempt-‘Yon are awretched
dilettante!

calve. note on vr 9.

57. aqualiculus is used by Sen. Ep.
90. 22 for the ventricle or ulterior sto-
mach-‘Cibus curn pervenit in ventrem,
aqualiculi fervore coquitur.' The trans-
ference to the exterior stomach or paunch
is probably Persius’ own. The schol. aud
Isidorus (Orig. 11. r) say that it is pro·
perly a pig’s stomach.

propenso is the reading of almost
all the MSS.. but ⁸ protenso,' which Heinr.
adopts, is found in Montep.. and in an
imitation by Jerome (adv. Jor. a. t. 4. a,
p. ²14 Ben). ‘protento' would be
the more usual form. The sentiment
is the same as that of the Greek proverb,
quoted by Pithoiis, παχεῖα γαστὴρ λεπτὸν
οὗ τίκτει νοόν, probably with the addi·
tional notiori that the would-be poet isa
bloated debauchee, ‘pinguls vitiis albus-
que' (Hor. 2 S. a. 21).

58. These three ways oi making game
of a person behind his back appear to be
mentioned nowhere else, except iu an
imitation by Jerome, though the second,

the lower part ol' the hand, so as to irni-
tate the appearance and the sound ot* a
stork’s bill. Jerome. however (E. 4. t. 4,
2. p. 77⁶ Ben.) has ‘ciconiarum depre-
hendes post te colla curvari!

pinsit is explained hythe schol,
(who makes it the perf. ofa supposed
‘pindo‚') ‘assidue percussis! Whether it
denotes simply the effect of the mockmy,
like ⁸ vellicare,' or anything in the manner
of it, is not clear. Plaut. Merc. 2. 3. 81
has ‘pinsere flagro!

59. imitari mobilis, like ‘artifex
sequi’ Prol. 11. Most MSS. have ‘imi-
tataest.’

albas distinguishes the ears as be·
longing to au ass. Ov. Met. 11. 174
says of the transformatiou of Midas,
‘Delius aures .. .. villisque albentibus
implet Instabilesque illas facit, et dat
posse moveri‚' which Persius may have
thought of, comp. v. 121. (Nebr.)‚ and
the choice of the epithetis quite in the
manner of Persius, so that we need not
embrace the reading of one MS. ‘ altas’

60. sitiat, where a prose writer would ¹

have said ⁴ sitiens protendat' Britannicus
says, ‘deest cum, ut sit cum sitiet!

The drought of Apulia is afamiliar
image from Hor. Epod. 3. 16 ‘siticulosae
Apuliae?

Jahn reads tautae with some of the
best MSS.; but ‘tantum' which is sup·
ported by most copies. is much nester,
