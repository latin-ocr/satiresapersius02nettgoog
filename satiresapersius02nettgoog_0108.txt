SAT. 111. 71

my chest, there’s no beat there3 touch my extremities, they're not
cold’ Suppose you happen to catch sight of a bit of money, does
your heart beat regularly then? Or say you have a tough vege·
table mess served up on a cold dish, with meal sisted through the
common sieve: now let us examine your palate: ah, you have a
-concealed putrid ulcer, which makes your mouth tender, and it
won’t do to let that coarse vulgar beet rub against it. So you
shiver‚ when pale fear sets up the bristles all over you, and then
when a fire is lighted underneath your blood begins to boil, and
your eyes sparkle with passion, and you say and do things which
Orestes, the hero of madmen, would depose to be the words and
actions of amadman.
