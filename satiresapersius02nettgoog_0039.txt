xlxii Lactora ow PERSIUS.

represented to me and, as it were, forced on me by the example os a writer
ol our own country, perhaps the most remarkable ol the present time,
wh0‚ though differing as widely frorn Persius in all his circumstances as a
world-wearied and desponding man of the nineteenth century can differ
ι from an enthusiastic and inexperienced youth of the first, still appears to
me to bear a singular resemblance to him in the whole character of his
genius-I mean Mr. Carlyle. If Persius can take the benerit of this
parallel, he may safely plead guilty to the charge of not having escaped
the vice ol his age, the passion for refining still further on Augustan
refinements of expression and locking up the meaning of a sentence in
epigrammatic allusions, which in its measure lies at the door even of
Tacitus.

Ι have exhausted my time and, Ι sear, your patience also, when my
subject is still far from exhausted. Iam glad, however, to think that in
closing I am not really bringing it to an end, but that some of my
hearerstoday will accompany me to-morrow and on future days in the
special study os one who, like all great authors, will surrender the fult
knowledge of his beauties only to those who ask it of him in detail.
