hinc trabe quae dicis, mensasque relinque Mycenis
cum capite et pedibus, plebeiaque prandia noris?
Non equidem hoc studeo, bullatis ut mihi nugis
pagina turgescat dare pondus idonea fumo.
secreti loquimur3 tibi nunc hortante Camena
excutienda damm praecordia, quantaque nostrae
pars tua sit, Cornute, animae, tibi, dulcis amice,
ostendisse iuvat: pulsa, dinoscere cautus,
quid solidum crepet et pictae tectoria linguae.
hic ego centenas ausim deposcere voces,
ut, quantum mihi te sinuoso in⁸ pectore lixi,
voce traham pura, totumque hoc verba resignent,

19. Helnr. and Jahn restore ‘pullatis’
from the larger number of Mss, including
tbe oldest, and suppose the meaning to he
‘sad-coloured,’ i. e. tragic. lt does not
appear, however, that ‘pullatus' is ever
applied to tragedy, though commonly
used 01 mourners: it answers more nearly
to ‘sordidatus' and in fact is frequently
applied to the common people, ‘Ne quis
pullatorum media cavea sederet,' Suet.
Aug. 44; a most unfortunate association
here, unless we can believe with Casaubon
that ‘nugae pullatae’ mean trifles that
please the vulgar. Unless then ‘pullatis’
bea mistake for ‘ampullatis’ which may
be worth considering, we must return to
tbe common reading ‘bullatis,' which has
very respectable MS. support, and ex·
plain it by ‘turgescat' ‘Bullatus' ordi·
narily means ‘furnished with bullae,' but
it may mean ‘formed like a 1111111,Ι
