or from the variety of measures of which it was composed—a more ¹
professional and artistic exhibition than the Fescennine bantering·
matches‚ but sar removed from the organized completeness os even the
earlier drama. It was on this narro'w ground that the independence ol ’
the Roman genius was destined to assert itself. Whether from awish
to take advantage of the name, or to preserve a thing, once popular,
from altogether dying out in the process of improvement, a feeling which
we know to have operated in the case of the exodzir or interludes intro-
duced into the representation of the Atellane plays, Ennius was led to
produce certain compositions which he called santes, seemingly as ”
various both in character and in versification as the old dramatic
medley, but intended not for acting but ior reciting or reading-in
other words, not plays but poems. All that we know of these is com-
prised in a few titles and avery few fragments, none of which tell us
much, coupled with the fact diat in one ol thern Life and Death were
introduced contending with each other as two allegorical personageS,
like Fame in Virgil, as Quintilian remarks, or Virtue and Pleasure in
the moral tale of Prodicus Little as this is, it is more than is known of
the satires of Pacuvius, of which we only hear that they resembled those
of Ennius. What was the precise relation borne by either to the later
Roman satire with which we are so familiar can but be conjectured.
Horace, who is followed as usual by Persius, ignores them both as
satirists, and claims the paternity oi satire ior Lucilius, who, as he says,
imitated the old Attic comcdy, changing merely the measure ; nor does
Quintilian mention thern in the brief but celebrated passage in which he
asserts the meritos the invention of satire to belong wholly to Rome.
This silence may be taken as showing that neither Ennius nor Pacuvius
gave any exclusive or decided prominence to that clement of satire
which in modern times has become its distinguishing characteristic—-
criticism on the men, manners, and things ol the day; but it can

· scarcely impeach their credit as the first founders of a new and ori-
ginal school os composition. That which constitutes the vaunted
originality of Roman satire is not so much its substance as its form: ,
the one had already existed in perfection at Athens, the elaboration
of the other was reserved for the poetic art of Italy. lt is certainly
not a little remarkable that the countrymen of Aristophanes and Ἴ
Menander should not have risen to the full conception of familiar
compositions in verse in which the poet pours out desultory thoughts
on contemporary subjects in his own person, relieved from the trammels
which necessarily bind every dramatic production, however free and l
unbridled its spirit. That such athing might easily have arisen among
them is evident from the traditional fame of the Homeric Margites, itsell
