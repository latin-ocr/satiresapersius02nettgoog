sar. 111. 69

l've buried lirin long ag0, and now l've got you in my way! ‘Go
on, l'm dumb.' So our hero goes to his bath, with his stomach
distended with eating and looking white, and a vapour of sulphu-
rous properties slowly oozing from his throat; but a shivering
comes on over the wine, and makes him let fall his hot tumbler from
his fingers; his teeth are exposed and chatter; the rich dainties
come back again from his dropping jaws. The upshot is horn-
blowing and tapers; and at last the deceased, laid out on a high
bed and daubed with coarse ointment‚ tums up his heels stark and
stiff towards the door; and citizens of twenty-four hours standing
in their caps os liberty carry him to the grave.
