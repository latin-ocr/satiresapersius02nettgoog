SAT. V. 85

grandiose go and catch vapours on Helicon, if there be any who
are going to set Progne or Thyestes’ pot a-boiling, to be the stand·
ing supper of poor stupid Glycon. But you are not squeezing
wind in a pair of panting bellows while the ore is smelting in the
furnace, nor are you croaking mysterious nonsense to yourself in
hoarse pent-up toneS, nor straining and puffing your cheeks till
they give way with aplop. No ; your line is to follow the lan·
· guage of common life, with dexterous nicety in your combinatione,
a'nd a moderate rounding of the cheek; your skill must be shown
in rubbing against the bloated skin of morality, and pinning vice
to the ground in sport which will do for gentlemen. Let this be

found only in an imitation by Jerome,⁴

Ep. 95, referred to by jahn) being sug·
gested by raucus.

grave is perhaps used here techni-
cally of a deep bass sound, opp. to
‘acutus'

inepte, perhaps from Hor. A. P. 140
‘qui nil molitur inepte‚' where the simple

13. A graphio amplification, ‘more

Persii,’ of llorace's ‘tumido ore' Α. Ρ. 94.

stloppo‚ a word occurring nowhere
else, perhaps coined by Persius, expressive
of sound, like ‘bombus' ι. 99 note.
‘Stloppo dixit gerocomium ludentibus
pueris, qui buccas inflatas subito aperiunt,
et toturn simul flatum curn sonitu fun·
dunt’ Schol. The spelling ‘stloppo' in·
stead of ‘seloppo' which many MSS.
give, is {opponet by Jahn from Priscian,
r.10.5 5.

intendis rumpere seems to bea
mixture of ‘intendis (temptas) rumpere'
and ‘intendis buccas dum rumpantur!
Compare ‘buccae' Juv. 11. 34³ for noisy
talkers‚ whom Plautus (Bacch. 5. 1. a)
calls ‘buccones3' ‘stloppo’ with ‘rum-
pere,’ as the noise would be a concomi-
tant of the bursting.
. 14. verba togae, like ‘fabula togata¹
(Hor. A. P. 288), the talk of common life
atRome‚opp.tothe‘praetexta‚’thesymbol
of tragedy, and the ‘pallium’ which be·
longed to Greek subjects. We must bear

Tantum de medio sumtis accedit honods'),
so that ‘notum' and ‘de medio sumtis'
answer to ‘verba togae!

iunctura (the same nretaphor asin
1. 65, 92, though the application there is
to the flow of the verse) refers here, as in
Horace, to the combination of words in a
happy phrase or expression.

acri is a well-chosen epithet, ex·
pressing the nicety of the material pro·
cess, as we use ‘sharp,’ at the same time
that it denotes keenness of mind.

15.v ore teres modico. Jahn well
compares ‘ore rotundo‘ Hor. A. P. 3²3,
which Persius doubtless was thinking of
here and in v.13. ‘Os tumidum' is an
exaggeration of ‘os rotundum,’ the full-
ness of the mouth in measured speech:
but as Persius had gone beyond ‘tumi-
dum,’ he is here satisfied with something
less than ‘rotundum’

modico qualifies teres, which itself
denotes smoothness within compass. ‘Ora-
tio plena, sed tamen teres' Cic. de Or. 3.
52, ‘with shapely mouth, moderately
rounded.'

pallentis mores. r. 26 ‘En pallor
seniumque! O nrorasf‘ Here the pale·
ness is doubtless that of dropsy and
disease, as irr 3. 94 foll. when any rough
application to the skin would be acutely
felt. Compare ⁸ rodere teneras auriculas'
r. 107, ‘rudere ulcus in tenero ore’ 3.
11 .

fd ingenuo . . ludo answers to Aris·
totle's definition of εὐτραπελία (Rhet. a.

in mind the relation of satire to the old ⁸12) as πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις. Noprecisely

cornic drama, asserted by.Persius himself,
1. 123. The whole line is imitated from
Hor. A. P. 47 ‘notum si callida verbum
Reddiderit iunctura novum’ (compare also
ib. 242 ‘Tantum series iuncturaque pollet,

similar instance of this use of ‘defigere'
has been adduced, but it is apparently the
same as that of ‘figere’ in such phrases
as ‘figere aliquem maledictis,' with the
additional notion of driving down.
