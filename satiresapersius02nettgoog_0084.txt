let those who send us dreams of nights most free from gross
humours rank first in honour, and have a golden beard given
them! Yes, gold has driven out Numa's crockery and the brass
of good old Satum; it supersedes the Vestal urns and the Etrus-
can pottery. Ο ye souls that cleave to earth and have nothing
heavenly in youl how can it answer to introduce the spirit of the
age into the temple-service, and infer what the gods like from
this sinful pampered flesh of ours? The flesh it is that has got
to spoil wholesome oil by mining casia with it-to steep Calabrian
wool in purple that was made for no such use3 that has made
us tear the pearl from the oyster, and separate the veins of the

61. in terras, for which Jahn restores
‘in terris,' is supported by one or two good
MSS. and by Lactant.r D. a. a, and is
recommended by the sense. jahn corn·

pulpa is a remarkable word, coin·
ciding as it does with the Christian lan·
guage about the flesh. especially when
coupled with the epithet ‘scelerata ;' ‘caro
mollis et enervis,' Jahn, who compares

inanes, with genitive, ‘inane lymphae
Dolium fundo pereuntis imo’ Hor. 3 Od.
11. ab, quoted by Jahn. The expression
‘coelestium inanes' resembles ‘Heu ste·
riles veri’ 5. 75.

62. Juhn reads quid iuvat hoc from
three good MSS.; but‘hos nostros,' which
is found in the great majority of Mss,
including the oldest, is supported by ‘hac
scelerata pulpa,¹ ‘sapere nostrum hoc' 6.
3 nostros.. mores, ‘misce Ergo ali-
quid nostris de moribus’ Juv. 14. gaa.
‘Mores’ as used by Roman authors, is a
very characteristic, and, almost by conse·
quence, untranslatable word, answering
more or less to several distinct though
connected notions in English: ‘national
character,'‘institutione’‘traditions,‘¹spirit
of the age,’ and the like. llere we may
perhaps render it mewa.

templis.. inmittere is the opp. to
‘tollere de templis' v. 7.

63. bona dis, to be taken together.

stand for ‘eaquae dis bona ridentur.¹

vitiato, ‘spoiled,' because changed
from its proper use. The evil done is
brought out more forcibly when it is as·
serted that both the natural products suffer
from the violation of their natures. In
Hom. ll. 4. 141, to which Jahn refers,
μιαίνειν probably ouly means to stain,
though virgil in his imitation (Aen. 12.
67) has ‘violaverit ostro.'

66. bacam, a common word for a
pearlt ‘diluit insignem bucam' lions S.
3. 241, here used perhaps to indicate the
relation of the pearl to the shell, as that
of a berry to a tree. So ‘crudo de pul-
vere' implies an interserence with the
processes of nature for the sake of luxury.
‘Aurum irrepertum etsie melius situm,
Cum terra celat’ Hor.3 Od. 3. 49.

rasisse implies violence, such as was
necessary to separate the pearl. ‘Crass
