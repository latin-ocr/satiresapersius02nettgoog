SAT. 111. 57

Ι Are you not ashamed to live the loose life of Natta? But he is
paralyzed by vice3 his heart is overgrown with thick collops oi
¹fat; he feels no reproach3 he knows nothing of his loss3 heis
sunlr in the depth and makes no more bubbles on the suriace.
Great Father oi the Gods, be it thy pleasure to inflict no other
punishment on the monsters of tyranny, after their nature hasbeen
stirred by fierce passion, that has thetaint oi fiery poison—let
them look upon virtue and pine that they have lost her for everl
Were the groans from the brazen bull of Sicily more terrible, or
did the sword that hung from the gilded comice strike more
dread into the princely neck beneath it than the voice which
whispers to the heart, ‘We are going, going down the precipice,'

not only as adding to the poetry of the
passage by combining the images of the
bull and the victim, but for the sake of

Od. 1.17 ‘Destrictua ensis cui super impia

41. purpureas.. cervices, a bolder
expression than ‘purpurei (=purpurati)
tyranui' Hor. r Od. 35.1s, from which
it is doubtless taken. The epithet so
chosen suggests the notion not merely of
splendour, but of the splendour of a tyrant,
so as to be virtually equivalent to Horace's
‘impia cervice! ‘Cervices' is usual for
‘cervia'
