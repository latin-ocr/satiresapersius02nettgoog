PREFACE.

The text adopted by Mr. Conington as abasis for his notes
was Otto Jahn’s of 1843. In 1868, however, Jahn published
a new text, which differs in many places from his earlier one.
l do not know how far, if at all, Mn Conington would have
followed him in his alterations, and have therefore been guided
hythe translation in fixing the reading to be adopted where
doubt would have arisen. lt will thus be found that the pre·

sent text approximateS, on the whole, more nearly to Jahn's ¹

01 1843 than to that of 1868. ,
Μ1. Conington collated, or had collated for him, seven MSS.

of Persius, two of which are in the Gale collection in the '

library of Trinity College‚ Cambridge. One of these is known

as Bentley’s Codex Galeanus, and is lettered y by Jahn in r

his edition of 1843. ‘It ie,’ says Mr. Conington in his descrip-

tion of it, ‘a small vellum MS. of the 8νο 01 12mo size. 11 ,

contains Horatii Opera, Persii Satirae, Throduli Eclogar, ¹

Cato de Moribus, and Aviani Fabulae. Collations of the Avi· Ἴ
anus, the Persius, and the Cato, were published in the Classical Ἴ
Journal, vol. 4, the former at pp. 120 foll, the two latter at
pp. 353 foll, by M. D. B. The Persius collation is very scanty
and not always accurate: but it appears to be the only one Ἴ
known to Jahn. Mr. Bradshaw refers the MS. to the twelfth ἶ

01 thirteenth century, almost certainly the former? The other ³
MS. in the Gale collection is referred by Mr. Bradshaw to the
ninth or tenth century, and is the most valuable of the seven

MSS. collated. It consists of one hundred and ten folios in
quires of eight, beginning on the second folio of the first quire,

and contains Juvenalis Satirae 1, Anmtatio Cornuti 93, Persii ¹

Satirarum Praemium 94 verso, Persii Satirar 95. ‘It appears,’
(l quote from Mr. Conington) ‘to be written throughout in the

same hand, the glosses being written in a much smaller cha· 1

racter. The only doubt is about certain glosses on the margin ζ
