nothing 01 the interchange, common in such MSS, 01 oo and e,
yand i. The monosyllabic prepositions are almost invariably
joined with their nouns (otumnlo, inlnxnm, etc.) and sometimes
even assimilated. The same is often the case with monosyl-

Assigned to the end 01 the tenth or beginning 01 the eleventh
