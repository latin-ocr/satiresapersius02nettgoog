duty of sincerity towards man and God, were doctrines at least as con'· 1
genial to a Stoic as to an Epicurean, and the ambition with which the
pupil is continually secking to improve upon his masters felicity of

. expression shows itself more successfully in endeavours to give greater
stringency to his rule of lise and conduct. Inone respect, certainly, we
may wonder that be has failed to represent the views of that section of
the Stoics with which he is reported to have lived on terms of familiar
intercourse. There is no trace of that political feeling which might have
been expected to appear in the writings of a youth who was brought
into frequent contact with the revolutionary enthusiasm of Lucan, and ¹
may probably have been present at one of the banquets with which
Thrasea and Helvidius used to celebrate the birthdays of the first and
the last of the great republican worthies. The supposed allusione to the
poetical character of Nero in the first satire shrink almost to nothing in
the light ofa searching criticism, while the tradition that in the original η
draught the emperor was directly satirized as Midas receives no counte-
nance, to say the least, from the poem itself, the very point of which, so
far as we can apprehendit, depends on the truth of the reading given in
the MSS. The fourth satire does undoubtedly touch on statesmanship:
but the tone throughout is that of a student, who in his eagerness to
imitate Plato has apparently forgotten that he is himself living not under
a popular but under an imperial govemment, and the moral intended to
be conveyed is simply that the adviser of the public ought to possess
some, better qualification than those which were found in Alcibiades—a ¹
topic about as appropriate to the actual state of Rome as the school-
boy’s exhortation to Sulla to lay down his power. Thus his language,
where he does speak, enables us to interpret his silence as the silence
not of acquiescence or even of timidity, though such times as his might
well justify cantion, but rather of unworldly innocence, satisfied with its
own aspirations after moral perfectiori, and dreaming of Athenian licence
under the very shade of despotism. On the other hand, it is perfectly ¹
intelligible that he should have seen little to admire in Seneca, many as ,
are the coincidences which their common philosophyhas produced in
their respective writings. There could, indeed, have been but little
sympathy between his simple earnestness and that rhetorical facility-
that Spanish taste for inappropriate and meretricious ornament—that
tolerant and compromising temper, able to live in a court while
unable to live in exile, which, however compatible with real wisdom
and virtue, must have seemed to a Stoic of a severer type only so
many qualifications for effectually betraying the good cause. Sc, again, Ἴ
he does not seem to exhibit any anticipation of the distinctly human l
and religious development which, as we have seen, was the final phase
