Tacitus and Suetonius have pourtrayed, and which pointed St. Paul’s ἶ
denunciation of the moral state of the heathen world. Stoicism was not y
regnant but militant-it produced. not heroes or statesmen‚ but con·
fessors and martyrs; and the early death which cut short the promise of

its Marcellus could not in such an age be called unseasonable.

It was about two hundred years since a Stoic had first appeared in
Rome as a member of the philosophie embassy which Athens de-
spatched to propitiate the conquering city. Like his companionS, he ζ
was bidden to go back to his school and lecture there, leaving the youth
of Rome to receive their education‚ as heretofore‚ from the magistrates
and the laws; but though the rigidity of the elder Cato triumphed
for a time, it was not sufficient effectually to exorcise the new spirit.
Panaetius, under whose influence the soul of Stoicism became more
humane and its form more graceful, gained the friendship of Laelius
and through him of Scipio Aemilianus, whom he accompanied on the
mission which the conqueror os Carthage undertook to the kings of
Egypt and Asia in alliance with the republic. The foreign philosophy
was next admitted to mould the most characteristic of all the pro-
ductions of the Roman mind—its Jurisprudence, being embraced by
along line of illustrious legists ; and the relative duties of civil life were ,
defined and limited by conceptions bonowed from Stoic morality. It
was indeed a doctrine which, as soon as the national prejudice against
imported novelties and a systematic cultivation had been surmounted,
was sure to prove itself congenial to the strictness and practicality of the .
old Roman character; and when in the last struggles of the common-
wealth the younger Cato endeavoured to take up the position of his
great ancestor as a reformet of manners, his rule of life was derived not
only from the traditions of undegenerate antiquity‚ but from the precepts
of Antipater and Athenodorus. The lesson was one not to be soon
lost. At the extinction of the republic, Stoicism lived on at Rome under
the imperial shadow, and the govemment of Augustus is said to have l
been rendered milder by the counsels of one of its professors; but when ,
the pressure of arr undisguised despotism began to call out the old
republican feeling, the elective affinity was seen to assert itself again.
This was the complexion of things which Persius found, and which he
left. That sect, as the accuser of Thrasea reminded the emperor, had
produced bad citizens even under the former regnae: its present ad-
herents were men whose very deportment was an implied rebuke to the
habits of the'imperial court3 its chief representative had abdicated his
official duties and retired into an unpatriotic and insulting privacy; and
the public records of the administration of affairs at home and abroad
