SAT. VI. 129

wards? are my remains to he abag othones, while he has a
priestly belly wagging about with lat? '

Sell your life sor gain3 do business; turn every stone in every
corner of the world, like a keen hand; let no one beat you at
slapping fat Cappadocians on the upright platform3 double your
capital. ‘There it is-three, four, ten times over it comes into my
purse: prick a hole where I am to stop! Chrysippus, the man to
limit your heap is found at last

ne sit te ditior alter' Hor. 1 S. 1. 40.

Compare Hor. rEp. 6.20r011.; ‘praestan-
tior alter' Virg. Aen. 6. 164.

‘Mille talenta rotundentur, totidem altera

quadret acervnm,' and imitated in turn by

rugam, ‘the sold of the garment,'
Plin. 35. Β. 34, as ‘sinus’ is used ola
punse: ‘rugam trahit' in the imitation by
Juv. 14. 325 looks aa if he had misunder-
stood the meaning here to be ‘makes you

explains ‘rugam' there of the ‘sinus' ls
there any allusion to ‘duplica' as if there
were a sold lor each sum?

80. ‘Why then Chrysippus¹ problem
has been solved,’-implying that the man
expects an impossibility.
