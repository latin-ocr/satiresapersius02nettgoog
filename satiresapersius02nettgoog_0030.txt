LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxiii

of Stoicism. His piety is simply the rational piety which would approve
itself to any Roman moralist-the piety recommended by Horace, and

afterwards by Juvenal-pronouncing purity of intent to be more accept·
able in the sight of Heaven than costly sacrifice, and bidding men ask
of the gods such things only as divine beings would wish to grant
In like manner his humanity, though genial in its practical aspect, is
still narrowed on the speculative side by the old sectarian exclusiveness
which barred the path of life to every one not catering through the gate
of philosophy. ln short, he is a disciple of the earlier Stoicism of the

empne-a Roman in his predilection for the ethical partos his creed,
yet confonning in other respects to the primitive traditions of Greece—
neither a patriot nor a courtier, but a reclusa student, an ardent teacher
of the truths which he had himself learnt, without the development which
might have been generated by more mature thought, or the abatement
which might have been forced upon him by a longer experiente.

We have already observed that the character of Persius' opinions
determined his choice ol a poetical vehiele for expressing them. With
his views it would have been as unnatural for him to have composed
a didactic treatise, like Lucretius, or a republican epic, like Lucan, as
to have rested satisfied with multiplying the productioris of his own boy-
hood tragedias and pilgrimages in verse. And now, what was the
nature and what the historical antecedents of that form of composition
which he adopted as most congenial ¹to him?

The exploded derivation of satire from the Greek satyrio drama is
one ol those not infrequent instances where a salse etymology has pre-
served a significant truth. There seems every reason to believe that the
first beginnings os satire among the Romans are parallel to the rudi-
mental type from which dramatic entertainments were developed in
Greece. ‘WhenI am reading on these two subiens} says Dryden‚ in
his admirable essay on Satire, ‘methinks 1 hear the same story told
twice over with very little alteration! The primitive Dionysiae festivals
of the Greek rustic populations seem to have answered with sufficient
exactness to the harvest-home rejoicings of agricultural Italy described
by Horace, when the country wits encountered each other in Fescennine
verses. Nor did the resemblance cease at this its earliest stage. Im-
provised repartee was succeeded by pantomimic representation and
dancing to music, and in process ol time the two elements, combined
yet discriminated from each other, assumed the form of a regular play,
with its alternate dialogues and cantica. Previous to this later develop-
ment there had been an intermediate kind ol entertainment called
the satura or medley‚ either¹ from the miscellaneous character of its
matter, which appears to have made no pretence to a plot or story,'
