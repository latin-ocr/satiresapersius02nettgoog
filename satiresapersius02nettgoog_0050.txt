SAT. l. 13

got up sprucely with a new toga, all in white with your birthday
ring on at last, perched up on a high seat, after gargling your
supple throat by a liquid process of tuning, with a languishing
roll of your wanton eye. At this you moysee great brawny sons
of Rome all in a quiver‚ losing all decency of gesture and com·
mand of voice, as the strains glide into their very bones, and the
marrow within is tiekled by the ripple of the measure. Whatl
an old man like you to become caterer for other men's ears-ears
to which you will be fain to cry Enough at last when bursting
yourselfi’

What is thc good of past study‚ unless this leaven—unless the
wild lig-trec which has once struck its root into the breast break
through and come out?

‘So much for pale looks and austerityl Alas sor our national

was constantly coupled. ‘Saltare ele·
gantius quarn necesse est probue’ Sall.
Cat. 25:

Rhamnes' Hor. A. P. 342, only that 'in-
gentes’ refers to the physicul siue of these
sons of old Rome (like ‘ingens Fulfen·
nius’ 5.190, ‘torosa iuventus’ 3. 86,
‘caloni alto' 5. 95), to show the mou-
strousness of the effeminacy to which
they are surrendering themselves.
trepidare like ‘exsultat’ v. 82,
they cannot keep their posture. Virgil's
‘stare loco nescit!
ar. tremulo seems to express the
movement of the line.
aa. vetule, note ou v. 9. ‘Do you
leud yourself to pampering the ears
of othersl' Casaubon compares the
Greek phrases adoxius and ἔστιάσειι
ἀκοῶν.
23. ‘Whem after all, you are sure to
be tired before they are satisfied?
cute perditusa‘cute perdita,' like
‘pede liber’=‘pede libero! lt is vari-
ously explained. The Schol. gives a
choico-⁴ emaciated by midnight study ’-
‘pale with old age'-aud ‘so diseased as to
show it even extemally.’ The early com·
mentators seem divided between the two
first, several of them quoting Juvenal’s
‘deformem pro cute pellem· Casaubon‚ fol·

though he thinks it may denote cuta-
neousdisease. Kiinig accepts neither view,
but supposes the point intended to be ina·

high fever. May it mean, ‘You will

23. ohe. Hor. 1 S. 5. ιτς a. 5. 96,
in which latter passage the first syllable
is short.

24-27. F. ‘What is the good of
study, unless a man brings out what he
has in himi’ P. ‘Hear the studenti
as if knowledge did no good to the
possessor unless he were known to pos·
sess itl’

24. Quo is read by a few MSS. Most
of the others have 'quid' which seems to
make no sense. ‘Quo tibi, Tilli, Sumere
depos6itum clavum fierique tribunoi’ lior.
18. ·²4·

25. iecore seems to mean little more
than the breast (like ‘fibra' v. 47; 5. 29).
In 5. 129 it probably denotes the liver as
the seat of passion, as in Hor. rod.
13. 4.

caprificus. ‘Ad quae Discutieuda
valent sterilis mala robora fici’ Juv. 10.
145. The harshness of the expression is
probably Persius' own, not an attempt to
ridicule the style he condemns.

46. pallor, of study, r.124; 3. 853
5. a.

senium. lior. 1 Ep. 18. 47 ‘in-

or to moroseness may be doubted. comp.

sense. ‘Here is the true student cha-
