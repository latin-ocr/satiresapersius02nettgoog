LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xv

by inscriptions which have been discovered there, as its memory was

ι Α long preserved by a tradition professing to point out his residence, and

by the practice of a noble house which was in the habit of using his
name. That name was already not unfamiliar at Rome, having been
borne by a contemporary of Lucilius, whose critical judgment the old
poet dreaded as that of the most learned man of the age, as well as by ¹
a successful officer in the time of the Second Punic War. Persius' early

Ι life was passed in his native town,a time to which he seems to allude ,

’ when he speaks of himself in his third satire as evading the lessons in

which he was expected to distinguish himself by his admiring father, and
ambitious only of eminence among his playmates. When he was six
years old bis father died, and his mother, Fulvia Sisennia, a genuine
Etruscan name, found a second husband, also of equestrian rank, called
Fusius, who within a few years left her a second time a widow. At
twelve years of age Persius was removed to Rome, where he studied
· under Remmius Palaemon the grammarian, and Verginius Flavius the
rhetorician. Of the latter, we only know that he had the honour of being
banished by N ero-on account, so Tacitus says, of the splendour of his
reputation—in the burst of jealous fury which followed the conspiracy of
Piso} that he wrote a treatise on rhetoric, to which Quintilian so re·
peatedly refers as authoritative, and that he made a joke ou a tedious
rival, asking him how many miles long his speech had been. Of the
former, an odious character is given by Suetonius who says that his
, extraordinary memory and facility of expression made him the most
popular teacher in Rome, but represents him as a manos inordinate
vanity and arrogance, and so infamous for his vices that both Tiberius
and Claudius openly declared him to be the last man who ought to be
trusted with the instruction of youth. The silence with which Persius
passcs over this part of his experience may perhaps be regarded as
significant when we contrast it with the language in which he speaks of
the next stage in his education. It was, he tells uS, when he first laid
aside the emblems of boyhood and assumed the toga—just at the time
when the sense of freedom begins, and life is seen to diverge into dif-
'ferent pathe-that he placed himself under another guide. This was
Annaeus Cornutus, a Stoic philosopher of great name, who was himself

afterwards banished by Nero for an uncourtly speech,-a man who, like
Probus has become a sort of mythical critic, to whom mistake or forgery '
has ascribed writings really belonging to a much later period. The con-
nection thus formed was never afterwards broken, and from that time
Persius seems to have declared himself a disciple of Stoicism. The
creed was one to which his antecedents naturally pointed, as he was
related to Arria, daughter of that ‘true wife' who taught her husband
