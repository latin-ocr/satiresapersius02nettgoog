xxx LECTURE ΟΝ THE

instance, that of Ben Jonson, that a man, not only of true comic genius
but of large experiences of life, may be so enslaved by acquired learning
as to satirize vice and folly as he reads of it in his books, rather than as
he sees it in society.

But time warns me that Ι must leave the yet unfinished list of the
intluences which worked or may have worked upon Persius, and say a
few words upon his actual merite as a writer. The tendency of what
has been advanced hitherto hasbeen to make us think of him as more
passive than active—as a candidate more for our interest and our
sympathy than for our admiration. But we must not forget that it
is his own excellence that has made him a classic-that the great and
true glory which, as Quintilian says, he gained by a single volume, has
been due to that volume alone. If we would justify the award of his
contemporaries and ol posterity, we must be ¹prepared to account for it.
It was not, as we have seen, that he was an originating power in philo-
sophy, or a many-sided observet of men and manners. He was a
satirist, but he shows no knowledge of many of the ingrediente which,
as Juvenal rightly perceived, go to make up the satiric medley. He was
what in modern parlance would be called a plagiarist-a charge which,
later if not sooner, must have told fatally on an otherwise unsupported
reputation. I might add that he is frequently perplexed in arrangement
and habitually obscure in meaning, were it not that some judges have
professed to discover in this the secretos his fame. A truer appreciation
will,I believe, be more likely to find it in the distinct and individual
character of his writings, the power of mind and depth ol feeling visible
throughout, the austere purity of his moral tone, relieved by frequent
outbreaks of genia] humour, and the condensed vigour and graphio
freshness of a style where elaborate art seems to be only' nature
triumphing over obstacles Probably no writer ever bonowed so much
and yet left on the mind so decided an impression of originality. His
description of the wilful invalid and his medical friend in the third satire
owes much of its colouring to Horace, yet the whole presentation is felt
to be his own-true, pointed, and sufficient. Even when the picture is
entirely Horatian, like that ol the over covetous manat his prayerS, in
the second satire, the effect is original still, though the very varieties
which discriminate it may be referred to hints in other parts ol Horace's
own works. We may wish that he had painted from his own observation
and knowledge, but we cannot deny that he has shown a painter's
power. And where he draws the life that he must have known, not
from the descriptions of a past age but from his own experience, his
portraits have an imaginative truth, minutely accurate yet highly ideal,

which would entitle thern to a distinguished place in any poetical gallery„ ,
