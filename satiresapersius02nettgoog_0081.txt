spirit as ‘pulmone et lactibus noctis' wgo.
fortunare is used absolutely, as in

'Deos ego omnes ut fortunussr'rrt precor,'
the subj. to ‘fortunare' being ‘penates’
‘Fortuna’ as Jahn remarks, is a ‘vox
sollennis' in prayers, being inrariably used
ol the gods. ‘Tu quamcunque Deos tibi
fortunaverit horarn Grata sume manu'
Hor. 1 Ep. 11. aa.

punctuation, ‘donec deeeptus et exspes,
Neprciquam suado, suspiret, nummus in

‘Nequiquam fundo nummus in imol'
(=‘nequiquam profundi opes meas’) the
