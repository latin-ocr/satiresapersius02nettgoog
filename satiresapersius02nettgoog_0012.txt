PREFACE ΒΥ THE EDITOR.

MOST of the late Mr. Conington’s friends and pupils will
remember his lectures on Persius, which were perhaps the
rnost generally popular ol all that he gave during his tenure
os the chair of Latin at Oxsord‚ owing to the sympathetic
humour with which he caught the peculiar force and flavour
of his author’s manner, as well as to the nerve and spirit of
his translation. The lecture prefixed to the commentary and
translation now published was among the first-fruita of his

professorial labours. Ι have no means os knowing how far he

considered it a final exposition of his views on Persius; but
its interest and merit are such that Ι need not, Ῑ am sure,
’ apologize for having it printed exactly as it was delivered.
The commentary and translation were written to be delivered
as lectures; but Mr. Conington lest them ina state so nearly
finished that little remained for an editor to do but to ex·
amine and fill in the references-a task which, owing to the
pressure of other work, Ι have been unable to fulfil as quickly
as Ι had originally hoped. Here and there Ι have added an
obvious parallel passage, and have also put in some references
to works now recognized as of standard authority which had
not appeared at the time when the notes were written. The
references to Lucretius, Catullus, and Propertius Ι have altered
(where necessary) to suit Munro’s, Ellis’, and Paley’s editions

respectively.
