xxviii LECTURE ΟΝ THE

for believing that the imitation may have extended further, and that
Persius' strictures on the poets of his day, and in particular on those
who affected ateste for archaisms, and professed to read the old Roman
drama with dehght, may have been studied after those irreverent criti·

cisms of the fathers of poetry, some of which, as the Scholiasts on
Horace inform us, occurred in this very tenth book of Lucilius. On
the ethical side we should have been hardly prepared to expect much
similarity: there is, however, a curious fragment ol Lucilius, the longest
of all that have corne down to us, containing a simple recital of the
various constituents of¹ virtue, the knowledge of duty no less than its¹
practice, in itself sufficiently resembling the enumeration of the elements
of morality which Persius makes on more than one occasion, and
showing atum for doctrinal exposition which was sure to be appre-
ciated by a pupil of the Stoics So there are not wanting indications
that the bold metaphors and grotesque yet forcible imagery which stamp
the character of Persius’ style so markedly may have been encouraged
if not suggested by hints in Lucilius, who was fond of tentative experi-
ments in language, such as belong to the early stages of poetry, when
the national taste is in a state of fusion. The admitted contrast
between the two men, unlike in all but their equestrian desecat,—
between the premature man of the world and the young philosopher,
the improvisatore who could throw off two hundred verses in an hour,
¹and the student who wrote seldom and slowly,-may warrant us in
doubting the success of the imitation, but does not discredit the fact
Our point is, that Persius attempted to wear the toga of his predecessor,
not that it fitted him.

. The influence of Horace upon Persius is a topic which has, in part,
been anticipated already. It is a patent fact which may be safely
assumed, and Ι have naturally been led to assume it as a help towards
estimating other things which are not so easily ascertainable. Casaubon
was, Ι believe, the first to bring it forward prominently into light in an
appendix to his memorable edition of Persius; and though one of the
later commentators has endeavoured to call it in question, cautioning us
against mistaking slight coincidences for palpable imitations, Ι am con·
fident that a careful and minute study of Persius, such asI have lately
been engaged in, will be found only to produce a more complete con-
viction of its truth: nor can Ι doubt that an equally careful perusal of
Horace, line by line and word by word, would enable us to add still
¹further to the amount of proof. Yet it is curious and instructive to
observe that it is a point which, while established bya superabundance
of the best possible evidence, that of ocular demonstration, is yet sin-
gularly deficient in those minor elementa of probability to which we are
