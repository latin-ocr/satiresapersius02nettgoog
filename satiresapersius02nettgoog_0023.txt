how to die, and herself married to Thrasea, the biographer and imitator
of the younger Cato. His literary profession was made soon after his η
education had been completed. He had previously written several
juvenile works—a tragedy, the narne of which has probably been lost
by a corruption in the MS. account of his life; a poem on Travelling .
(perhaps a record of one of his tours with Thrasea, whose favourite and .
frequent companion he was) in imitation os Horace's Journey to Brun-
dusium, and of a similar poem by Lucilius; and a few verses commemo· 1
rative of the elder Arria. AlterwardS, when he was fresh from his
studies, the reading of the tenth book of Lucilius diverted his poetical
ambition into a new channel‚ and he applied himself eagerly to the
composition of satires after the model of that which had impressed him
so strongly. The later Scholiasta a class of men who are rather apt to
evolve facts, as well as their causes, partly from the text itself which they
have to illustrate, partly from their general knowledge of human nature, ⁴
tell us that this ardour did not preclude considerable vacillation: he
deliberated whether to write or not, began and left off, and then began
again. One of these accounts says that he hesitated for some time
between a poetical and a military life-a strange but perhaps not in·
credible story, which would lead us to regard the frequent attacks on the
army in his Satires not merely as expressions of moral or constitutional
antipathy, but as protests against a former taste of his own, which may
possibly have still continued to assert itself in spite of the precepts of
philosophy. He wrote slowly‚ and at rare intervals, so that we may l
easily imagine the six Satires which we possess-an imperfect work, we are
told-to represent the whole of his career as a professed author. The
‘remaining notices of his life chiefly respect the friends with whom his
philosophical or literary sympathies led him to associate. The earliest
of these were Caesius BassuS, to whom his sixth satire is addressed—
himself a poet of some celebrity, being the only one of his generation
whom Quintilian could think of including with Horace in the class of
Roman lyrists-and Calpurnius Statura, whose very name is a matter
of uncertainty. He was also intimate with Servilius Nonianus, who
would seem from an incidental notice to have been at one tirne his
preceptor-a man of consular dignity‚ distinguished, as Tacitus informs
us, not merely by high reputation as an orator and a historian, but by
the polished elegance of his life. His connection with Cornutus, who
was probably a freedman of the Annaean family, introduced him to
Lucan; and dissimilar as their temperaments were, the young Spaniard
did ample justice to the genius of his friend, scarcely restraining himself ἵ

from clamorous expressions of rapture when he heard him recite his
verses. Ata later period Persius made the acquaintance of Seneca, but '
