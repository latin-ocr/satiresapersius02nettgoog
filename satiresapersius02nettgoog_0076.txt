SAT. ΙΙ. 39

ready to do away with muttering and whispering from our temples,
and live in the use of prayers to which all may ksten. ‘Sound
mind, good report, credit'-so much is said aloud even in a

‘O that my uncle would go off in a splendid obituary. O that
Ι could hear a crock of silver chinking under my harrow, by.- the
blessing of Hercules-or that I might strike out my ward, on
whose heels Ι tread as next in succession, so full of scrofula and

Twelve Tables provided that where no
guardian was appointed by will, the next

formed his notions of life as much from
books as from experiente.

For ducitur many MSS. give ‘con-
ditur,’ perhaps, as jahn thinks, from a
confusion o'f this passage with Mart. 10.
43. Serv. on Virg. G. 4. 256 explains
‘ducitur’ ‘is carried out to burial,'
but ‘ducitur uxor' can only have one
meaning, and the words properly under·
stood express the sense which Servius
wishes, only with more skill. ‘Nerius is
